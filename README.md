# SVM

`one.py` uses sklearn and the make_blobs dataset and draws the decision boundry and margins
<hr>

`two.py` is pretty much the same idea but easier to understand and following <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/linear-svc-example-scikit-learn-svm-python/">this</a> tutorial
<hr>

`three.py` this one uses multiple kernels
<hr>

`four.py` just one more example to make sure I've got this in the bag:D
